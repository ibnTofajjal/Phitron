# In this module We're talking about time and space complexity.

### 1.2

- Every Server gives us 10^7 operations per second.
- if we have 10^9 operations then it will take 10 seconds to complete.
- if we have 10^10 operations then it will take 100 seconds to complete.
- if we have 10^11 operations then it will take 1000 seconds to complete.
- if we have 10^12 operations then it will take 10000 seconds to complete.

and if our code is not optimized then it will take more time to complete. so we need to optimize our code.
