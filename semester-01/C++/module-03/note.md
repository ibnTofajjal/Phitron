# Why We need Class and Object

### Class

    - Class is a blueprint of an object.
        * blueprint means a plan or a design.
    - Class is a user defined data type.
        * user defined data type means we can create our own data type.
    - Class is a collection of objects.
        * collection of objects means a group of objects.
    - Class is a logical entity.
        * logical entity means it is not a physical entity.
    - Class is a template.
        * template means a pattern.
    - Class is a group of similar objects.
        * similar objects means objects of same type.

### Object

    - Object is an instance of a class.
        * instance means an example.
    - Object is a real world entity.
        * real world entity means a physical entity.
    - Object is a physical entity.
        * physical entity means it is not a logical entity.
    - Object is a runtime entity.
        * runtime entity means it is created at runtime.
    - Object is a variable of class type.
        * variable of class type means a variable which is created from a class.
    - Object is a dynamic memory allocation.
        * dynamic memory allocation means memory is allocated at runtime.
